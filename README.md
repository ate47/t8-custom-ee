# t8-custom-ee
A tool to allow EEs in local or custom mutation in Black Ops 4 ([Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGUf-qEcHMU))

Load the zombies mode and press "Inject mod", you can remove the mod using "Reverse mod".

This mod is using the knowledge of the [t8-compiler by Serious](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7-compiler), it replaces the `function_e51dc2d8`'s bytecode to `return true` to enable step EEs even if you are in casual, local or custom mutation.

This mod is a temp modification knowing the detour API isn't available for Black ops 4 in the t8-compiler.
